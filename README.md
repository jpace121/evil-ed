;;; Jimmy's evil emacs config

insert emacs joke here.

THIS IS EXPERIMENTAL AND BLANTANTLY BUGGY.

;; About

Suped up emacs for someone who is a vim guy, but wanted to play with something,
and use something that is really super configureable.

;; Flycheck Needs

Flycheck depends on external tools for checking.

I have:
   Clang for C/C++
   flake8 for python
   chktex
   hunspell

For Irony mode I downloaded (through apt):
    libclang-7-dev
    cmake
    build-essential
    clang-tools-7
    build-essential
and then ran:
    irony-install-server
